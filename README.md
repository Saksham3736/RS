## WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT:
#### 1. Arrange the following microwave bands in the order of increasing frequency.

  * L, X, K, Ka
  * P, Ka, C, S
  * Ku, X, S, P
  * L, C, K, X

**Answer:** The correct order of increasing frequency is **L, X, K, Ka**.

**Concept:** Microwave bands are classified based on their frequency. As the speed of light ($c$) is constant, frequency ($\nu$) and wavelength ($\lambda$) are inversely proportional ($c=\nu \lambda$). This means that as frequency increases, wavelength decreases.Based on the provided table, the approximate frequency ranges for each band are:

  * **L-band:** 1-2 GHz
  * **X-band:** 8-12.5 GHz
  * **K-band:** 18-26.5 GHz
  * **Ka-band:** 26.5-40 GHz

#### 2. The major source of energy for passive remote sensing in the LWIR region is:

  * Sun’s radiation
  * Emission from the earth surface
  * Emission from the sensor
  * None of the above

**Answer:** The major source of energy is **Emission from the Earth's surface**.

**Concept:** Passive remote sensing utilizes energy that is naturally available. While the Sun is the primary source of energy for the visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum, objects on the Earth's surface absorb this solar energy and re-emit it as thermal radiation, especially in the **Long-wave Infrared (LWIR)** region (beyond $8µm$). A passive sensor then detects this emitted thermal energy to gather information.

#### 3. If the plane of vibration of the electric field of EMR is parallel to the plane of incidence, then it is said to be ________ polarized.

  * Circularly
  * Vertically
  * Horizontally
  * Randomly

**Answer:** Based on the provided answer key, the accepted answer is **Horizontally** polarized.

**Concept:** This is a key concept in the physics of electromagnetic waves. **Polarization** describes the orientation of the electric field's vibration. The **plane of incidence** is the plane that contains the incoming light ray and the normal to the surface.

  * **Vertical Polarization** (or p-polarization) is when the electric field's vibration is **parallel** to the plane of incidence.
  * **Horizontal Polarization** (or s-polarization) is when the electric field's vibration is **perpendicular** to the plane of incidence.

Based on these standard definitions, the answer for a vibration **parallel** to the plane of incidence should be **Vertically** polarized. The provided answer key appears to be incorrect based on this standard convention.

#### 4. When the sky is completely clear without any clouds, dust or any other impurities, which type of scattering is expected to happen?

  * Non-selective
  * Rayleigh
  * Both options a and b
  * No scattering will take place

**Answer:** The expected scattering is **Rayleigh** scattering.

**Concept:** **Scattering** is the deflection of electromagnetic radiation by particles in the atmosphere. The type of scattering depends on the size of the particles relative to the wavelength of the radiation. **Rayleigh scattering** occurs when the particles (like nitrogen and oxygen molecules) are much smaller than the wavelength of the light. This is why a clear sky appears blue, as shorter wavelengths (blue) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red). **Non-selective scattering**, by contrast, occurs when particles (like water droplets in clouds) are much larger than the wavelength, scattering all colors equally.

#### 5. Human eyes will not be able to see___________ portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

  * Infrared
  * Blue
  * Green
  * Red

**Answer:** Human eyes will not be able to see the **Infrared** portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

**Concept:** Our eyes are only sensitive to a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum called the **visible spectrum**, which ranges from approximately $0.4$ to $0.7 µm$. This is the energy range we perceive as light and color (red, green, and blue). The Sun provides energy across a much larger portion of the spectrum, including the infrared and ultraviolet regions, which our eyes cannot detect.

#### 6. Which of the following phenomenon causes haze in an otherwise good quality image?

  * Scattering
  * Reflection
  * Refraction
  * All the above

**Answer:** The phenomenon that causes haze is **Scattering**.

**Concept:** **Haze** in a remote sensing image is caused by the unpredictable diffusion of electromagnetic radiation by particles in the atmosphere, such as dust, smoke, and water vapor. This scattering adds unwanted "noise" to the signal reaching the sensor, reducing the clarity and contrast of the image.

#### 7. If a wave completes 1500000000 full cycles in one second, what is the wavelength of the wave?

  * 3 m
  * 15 m
  * 0.2 m
  * 2 m

**Answer:** The wavelength of the wave is **0.2 m**.

**Concept:** This is a direct application of the fundamental relationship between the speed of light ($c$), frequency ($\nu$), and wavelength ($\lambda$), given by the equation:
$c = \nu\lambda$
Given:

  * Frequency ($\nu$) = 1,500,000,000 Hz = $1.5 \times 10^9$ Hz
  * Speed of light ($c$) = $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

Solving for wavelength:
$$\lambda = \frac{c}{\nu} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \ m/s}{1.5 \times 10^9 \ Hz} = 0.2 \ m$$

#### 8. During daytime, in which of the following wavelengths, we will have both reflected solar radiation and emission from the earth surface?

  * Mid Wave Infrared
  * Near Infrared
  * Longwave Infrared
  * All of these

**Answer:** The wavelength where we have both reflected solar radiation and emission from the Earth's surface is **Mid-Wave Infrared**.

**Concept:** Remote sensing divides the electromagnetic spectrum based on the primary source of energy detected[cite: 151].

  * The **Near-Infrared** region (0.7-1.4 µm) is dominated by reflected solar radiation.
  * The **Long-wave Infrared** region (beyond 8 µm) is dominated by thermal radiation emitted from the Earth's surface.
  * The **Mid-Wave Infrared** (3-8 µm) is a unique region where both reflected solar energy and emitted thermal energy from the Earth's surface are present, especially during the day.

#### 9. Which of the following law describes the spectral variation of energy?

  * Stefan Boltzmann law
  * Kirchoff’s law
  * Wien’s displacement law
  * Planck’s law

**Answer:** The law that describes the spectral variation of energy is **Planck’s law**.

**Concept:** **Planck's law** describes the spectral distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody at a specific temperature. It provides a mathematical function that shows how the energy radiated by an object varies with wavelength. Other related laws include:

  * **Stefan-Boltzmann law**, which describes the **total** energy radiated by a blackbody over all wavelengths.
  * **Wien's displacement law**, which relates the **peak** wavelength of radiation to temperature.
  * **Kirchhoff's law**, which states that for a body in thermal equilibrium, its emissivity equals its absorptivity.

#### 10. If a light wave of wavelength λ is travelling through 3 mediums, medium 1 with particles of size 0.05λ, medium 2 with particles of size 15λ and medium 3 with particles of size 5λ, then non-selective scattering, Mie scattering and Rayleigh scattering will occur respectively in:

  * Medium 3, medium 2 and medium 1
  * Medium 1, medium 2 and medium 3
  * Medium 2, medium 3 and medium 1
  * Medium 2, medium 1 and medium 3

**Answer:** Non-selective scattering, Mie scattering, and Rayleigh scattering will occur respectively in **Medium 2, Medium 3, and Medium 1**.

**Concept:** The type of scattering that occurs depends on the size of the atmospheric particles relative to the wavelength ($\lambda$) of the light.

  * **Rayleigh Scattering** occurs when particle size is much smaller than the wavelength ($<\lambda/10$). This applies to **Medium 1** (0.05$\lambda$).
  * **Mie Scattering** occurs when the particle size is approximately equal to the wavelength ($\approx \lambda$). This applies to **Medium 3** (5$\lambda$).
  * **Non-selective Scattering** occurs when particle size is much larger than the wavelength ($$>10\lambda$$). This applies to **Medium 2** (15$$\lambda$$).
